# Olympic-Analysis
120 Years of Olympic History: A Data Analysis Using SQL. In this project, I explored and analyzed a vast dataset spanning over a century of Olympic Games, employing the power of SQL to extract valuable insights from the wealth of information available. 

## Language 
I have used to MySQL to solve all the queries. The SQL code is written on a Python as I wanted to use Python Magic for SQL and explore how SQL commands can be written in jupyter notbook files.

## Dataset 
The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about various Olympic events, athletes, countries, sports disciplines, and their respective results. It provides a comprehensive record of Olympic history, allowing us to analyze trends, patterns, and statistics across different editions. The dataset is from Kaggle '120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results'.
